## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Project scaffold: three targets — `SwiftOAuthCore`, `SwiftOAuthProvider`,
  `SwiftOAuthClient` — with neither half depending on the other
- `project/plans/proposals/SwiftOAuthDesign.md`, the full design: two storage protocols
  rather than one, `consume` rather than get-then-delete for single-use artifacts, and the
  three refresh-rotation hazards the client half exists to handle
- `project/master_plan.md`

Nothing is implemented yet. The extraction from SwiftMCPServer is sequenced so that
SwiftMCPServer's own quality gate acts as the control: if it cannot be made green against the
extracted package, the extraction was wrong and is reverted rather than patched.
